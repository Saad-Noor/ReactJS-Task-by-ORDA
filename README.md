# ReactJS-Task-by-ORDA

React component which updates itself every second and displays the current second of a wall clock inside a &lt;div >&lt;/div> element.  If the current second is a multiple of three, it displays "Fizz". If the current second is a multiple of five it displays "Buzz". If the current second is a multiple of three and five it displays "FizzBuzz". This is really intersting task to play with Watch.
